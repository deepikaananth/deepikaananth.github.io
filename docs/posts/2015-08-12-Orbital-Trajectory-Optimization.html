<h2 id="introduction-and-motivation">Introduction and Motivation</h2>
<p>In the Fall of 2022, a small team and I became interested in spacecraft path planning and set up a toy version of the problem. It soon materialized into a hypothetical orbital system with some <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> number of space debris pieces in elliptic orbits that we would have a spacecraft “intercept” to collect<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Such a space trash collector<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> might not be able to collect too many junk pieces in real life just yet, and ours was a highly fantastical set up, but the problem was too irresistible to turn down because it was the (time-varying) travelling salesman problem!</p>
<p>The travelling salesman is a notoriously famous combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is for a salesman to find the shortest <a href="#hamilton"><strong>Hamiltonian cycle</strong></a> through
<span id="hamilton">
<small class="sidenote">
<u><strong>Hamiltonian Cycle</strong></u><br>
Named after 19<span class="math inline">\(^{th}\)</span> century mathematical Sir William Rowan Hamilton, most famously known for his invention of the concept of <em>quaternions</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, a Hamiltonian cycle is a “tour” of a graph beginning and ending at the same vertex.
</small>
</span>
some <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> cities. The complexity of the question becomes more apparent upon closer inspection to those to whom it might be new:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Starting from the first city, there are n-1 cities to pick from, from the second only n-2 and so on…</li>
<li>Simply picking the closest city every time will not always (almost never in fact!) lead to a summed shortest travelled distance.</li>
<li>The constraint that says the salesman has to travel back to the first city to complete a required round-trip makes the <a href="#mst"><strong>minimum spanning tree</strong></a> based
<span id="mst">
<small class="sidenote">
<u><strong>Minimum spanning tree</strong></u><br>
The MST is the shortest possible “tree” creating routes in a weighted graph such that the path from any one node to another will always be the shortest possible path!

</span>
approach intractable.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Now imagine a similar problem with space debris collection, where the pieces of debris are all continuously moving. This is the time-varying travelling salesman.</p>
<h2 id="elliptical-orbits---problem-set-up">Elliptical orbits - problem set up</h2>
<p>The first step was to create the environment by simulating elliptical orbits for the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> pieces of debris our spacecraft trash collector has to collect. This was done by using the parametric equation of the 2-ellipse in 3-dimensional space:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x(t) = u_x \hspace{0.2cm} cos(t) + v_x \hspace{0.2cm} sin(t) + c_x\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[y(t) = u_y \hspace{0.2cm} cos(t) + v_y \hspace{0.2cm} sin(t) + c_y\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[z(t) = u_z \hspace{0.2cm} cos(t) + v_z \hspace{0.2cm} sin(t) + c_z\]</span></p>
<p>The way I understood the intuition behind this parametrization was by considering the projections of an ellipse so generated onto the three orthogonal planes like shown in <a href="#proj"><strong>Fig 1.</strong></a> The ellipse
<span id="proj">
<small class="sidenote">
<u><strong>An ellipse in 3D space and its projections</strong></u><br>

<strong>Fig 1.</strong> A 2-ellipse in 3D space and its projections onto the XY, YZ and XZ planes.
</small>
</span>
in the sidenote was generated using the values <span class="math inline">\(u_x = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(u_y = 2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(u_z = 4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_x = 5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_y = 3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_z = 0\)</span> with the constants <span class="math inline">\(c_x, c_y, c_z\)</span> all 0. This can be interpreted in two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The projections are each a 2-ellipse which have parametric equations with the coefficient constants picked in pairs from the 3 available sets, to produce ellipses of the form:
<span class="math display">\[x(t) =  cos(t) + 5 sin(t)\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[y(t) = 2cos(t) + 3sin(t)\]</span>
For readers familiar with the standard ellipse equation:
<span class="math display">\[ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\]</span>
a simple substitution into the standard ellipse equation of the following form:
<span class="math display">\[ x = a cos(\theta); \hspace{1cm} y = b sin(\theta) \]</span>
reveals the trigonometric identity:
<span class="math display">\[ \frac{a^2 cos^2(\theta)}{a^2} + \frac{b^2 sin^2(\theta)}{b^2} = cos^2(\theta) + sin^2(\theta) = 1 \]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The ellipse created in 3D space is that unique 2-ellipse which passes through the two 3D vectors <span class="math inline">\(u = (1, 2, 4)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v=(5, 3, 0)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ant-colony-optimization">Ant Colony optimization</h2>
<p>The authors of <em>Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms for Dynamic Optimization:
A Case Study of the Dynamic Travelling Salesperson Problem</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> describe in detail the two kinds of “swarm intelleigence metaheuristic based” approaches to solving the travelling salesman problem - the evaporation based approach and the population based approach. A few points of importance applicable to both techniques are listed below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ant colony optimization
<span id="memory">
<small class="sidenote">
<u><strong>Pheromone trails as memory</strong></u><br>
The behavior of ants makes for pheromone trails as an excellent representation of dynamic memory. Their intensities are a popularity vote amongst members of the colony that is always changing with time.
</small>
</span> (henceforth refered to as ACO) is inspired by the behavior of eusocial insects which live in colonies like ants who deposit a continuous trail of pheromones along a suitable path between their homes and a food source, telling others in the colony <a href="#memory"><strong>how to reach that food source</strong></a>.</li>
<li>A more viable food source
<span id="food">
<small class="sidenote">
<u><strong>Does closest = = best ?</strong></u><br>
The foragaing behavior of ants in the wild is pretty random until a good food source is located. This means that those ants that find food sources the quickest will be able to return to the colony the fastest to “tell” their mates and attract more footfall along that route. This is however not indicative of long term states of the pheromone trails, and emergent behaviour at a future time could favor completely different paths.
</small>
</span>
will attract a greater number of ants and will in turn <a href="#food"><strong>strengthen the pheromone trail</strong></a> along the path to it, attracting even greater footfall.</li>
<li>Pheromone trails do not last forever and so, disuse caused by dwindling food supplies at the destination will reflect in the loss of strength in the pheromone deposits along that path.</li>
<li>And finally, the dynamic (time-varying) nature of the problem means that as the state of the system changes (the food supply locations for the foraging ants), there is suddenly a new world state and having to start from sractch to find the optimal solution would be a waste. Instead, there has to be a way to computationally carry over the effects of learned paths from the previous world state into future and at the same time continue to fine tune in order to find an optimal solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said,

<u><strong>Evolution of Pheromone trails over time</strong></u>
<img src="../../Images/phero.png" data-wdith="80%" alt="Image" /><br>
<strong>Fig. 2.</strong> Pheromone trails at initial time, and after 4 and 8 iterations of the ACO algorithm
</small>
</span>
the general idea behind ACO and how we used it to find an optimal path between N pieces of debris is listed as below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The G(N, A) graph with the N pieces of debris as its nodes, and the arcs A connecting each to every other, initialized with the distances between them is the world state,</li>
<li>the world state is constantly changing, but the known orbital parameterizations make for easy predictions of exactly where every space junk piece will be at any future time,</li>
<li>some <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> number of ants are randomly distributed amongst the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> nodes at the beginning and will travel to every other node and back in each iteration of the algorithm.</li>
<li>the total path length is simply the sum of distances travelled along an approximated elliptic path connecting any two debris at the instance of calculation, a necessary simplification we had to use in order to speed up running time,</li>
<li>the best pheromone trail is strengthened at the end of every iteration while the others lose some strength,</li>
<li>but, all trails also lose some of their potency (even the current iteration best which gets a reinforcement as mentioned in 5.), in order to have a diminishing returns effect as time progresses and the debris pieces move into vastly different arranegements than they used to be when the previous optimal path was computed,</li>
<li>finally, multiple runs must be conducted in order to settle upon a quasi-optimal solution for this algorithm.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given below is the algorithm for the evaporation based scheme of ACO algorithms, with the world state being that the positions of the pieces of space debris (nodes) and the paths between them (arcs) together are represented in the form of a graph G(N, A):</p>

<p>This section describes the way I programmed the algorithm and its nuances along with snippets of code with descriptions of the various functions.</p>
<h4 id="creating-the-orbits">Creating the orbits</h4>
<p>The first section was creating the orbits and testing them out, and so the the parametric equations were hard coded to take in the <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> vectors along with the centers <span class="math inline">\(c = (0,0,0)\)</span> for each of the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> orbits. The output of the set-up we used for the final results is shown below in <strong>Fig 3.</strong></p>

</center>
<h4 id="how-every-ant-picks-its-next-node">How every ant picks its next node</h4>
<p>Each of the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> number of ants is initialized to one of the 9 random nodes at the start of the algorithm. And at every step, a set of probablistic rules helps each ant pick its next node.</p>
<p>We can begin to comprehend this scheme with the first parameter of interest <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> is 0 the scheme of choice is called the <a href="#pij"><strong><em>random proportional decision rule</em></strong></a> and the given some pre-defined parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> we define the following new quantity:</p>
<p><span id="pij">
<small class="sidenote">
<u><strong>Random proportional decision rule:</strong></u><br>
<span class="math inline">\(p_{ij}^k\)</span> : the <span class="math inline">\(k^{th}\)</span> ant’s probability of going to node <span class="math inline">\(N_j\)</span> from current <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span><br>
<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{ij}\)</span> : the pheromone trail strength between <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_j\)</span><br>
<span class="math inline">\(\eta_{ij}\)</span> : 1/(distance between <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_j\)</span>)
</small>
</span>
<span class="math display">\[ p_{ij}^k =\frac{ [\tau_{ij}]^{\alpha} \hspace{0.2cm} [\eta_{ij}]^{\beta} }{ \sum_l   [\tau_{il}]^{\alpha} \hspace{0.2cm} [\eta_{il}]^{\beta}  } \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> is the inverse of the graph weights connecting the corresponding nodes in the subscripts indices (in our case, the actual distance along an approximated elliptical orbit between two space junk pieces). An ant will thus pick its next node <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> using the calculated <span class="math inline">\(p_{ij}\)</span> from among <a href="#remain"><strong>the remaining number of debris pieces</strong></a>,
<span id="remain">
<small class="sidenote">
<u><strong>Remaining nodes</strong></u><br>
The travelling salesman (in our case the space trash collector) can visit every node only once! This means that the algorithm will have one lesser node to consider for every ant at every iteration.
</small>
</span> simply as the one with highest probability:
<span class="math display">\[ j = \text{argmax} \Big\{ p_{ij}^k  \Big\} \]</span></p>
<p>However, when <span class="math inline">\(1 &gt; q_0 &gt; 0\)</span> (it is also a probability) we have a choice and will be opting for what is called the <a href="#new""><strong><em>pseudorandom proportional decision rule</em></strong></a>. The choice lies in that, with a probability of <span class="math inline">\(1 - q_0\)</span>, an ant will choose according to the <a href="#pij"><em>random proportional rule</em></a> defined above, and with a probability of <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, will choose according to metric:</p>
<p><span id="ab">
<small class="sidenote">
<u><strong>alpha and beta</strong></u><br>
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are two pre-defined parameters that are used to prioritize the <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> values over the <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> values or vice-versa. Their significance becomes clear when considering which might be bigger in value: when <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is greater, the <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> values - the pheromone trails indicative of solutions from past iterations are prioritized; and when <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is greater, the <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> values or the current weights of the Graph edegs are prioritized.

<span class="math display">\[ j = \text{argmax}_{l \in N_i} \Big\{ [\tau_{il}]^{\alpha} [\eta_{il}]^{\beta}  \Big\}  \]</span></p>
<h4 id="updating-the-pheromone-trails">Updating the pheromone trails</h4>
<p>The pheromone trails are updated at every step of the algorithm after all the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> ants have a path through the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> nodes and the iteration best path among all has been computed: <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{ib}\)</span>.</p>

<li><p>then do a bieased coin toss based on a pre-determined probability value <span class="math inline">\(1 &gt; q_{pheromone} &gt; 0\)</span> (in code as <code>self.q_ph</code>) that selects a <a href="chosen"><strong>chosen path</strong></a> between the current iteration best <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{ib}\)</span> and the overall best solution path <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{bs}\)</span> (from all iterations so far),
<span id="chosen">
<small class="sidenote">
<u><strong>Chosen path</strong></u><br>
The chosen path is determined by a biased coin flip as either <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{ib}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{bs}\)</span> to account for the dynamic nature of the world state. For a large number of ants, there will always be a <span class="math inline">\(q_{ph}\)</span> number of them who chose to go with the current iteration best over the overall best solution, discarding optimality/memory of an older, better path for a new one! The greater this <span class="math inline">\(q_{ph}\)</span>, the more credence we give to new solutions over older ones; resulting in longer convergence time.

</span></p></li>
<li><p>finally, every edge <span class="math inline">\(G(A_{ij})\)</span> in the <em>chosen best</em> path is updated with pheromone deposits between nodes <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_j\)</span> <a href="#weight"><strong>inversely proportional to the edge weights</strong></a> at that time instance!</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="weight">
<small class="sidenote">
<u><strong>The role of graph edge weights</strong></u><br>
The pheromone trail update rules are not only discriminatory w.r.t fresh deposits (reinforcement), but also only do so in quantities inversely proportional to the corresponding graph edge weights! This makes sense since even though those edges connected nodes along the chosen path are being sterngthened (chosen against all odds!), the dynamic nature of the system means that current optima need not be optimum anymore even a few time instances later. Therefore, debris pieces closer to out current position will get reinforced more strongly compared to those further away.

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>This section contains a few remarks based on my observations from multiple runs about the influence of the various metrics and factors that constitute the ACO algorithm.</p>
<h4 id="effect-of-the-number-of-ants">Effect of the number of ants</h4>
<p>While it is true that a greater number of ants results in a more accurate distribution of choices based on biased coin flips wherever necessary throughout algorithm, having way too many ants only slows the process.</p>
<p>In contrast as one would expect, too few ants do not always find the optimal solution that 75 or more ants tend to find. And, the greater the number of nodes to traverse through, the more the requisite number of ants becomes.</p>
<h4 id="evaporation-rate">Evaporation rate</h4>
<p>Most of my runs were done with the recommended <span class="math inline">\(\rho=0.8\)</span> evaporation rate. However, since the value of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is not the only factor influencing how the pheromone trails change over time, changing them to a value much smaller resulted in the algorithm terminating prematurely with no more trail updating happening by virtue of nearly 0 valued trail strengths early into the simulation.</p>
<p>And just as logic dictates, the closer to 1 the value took, the longer it took until convergence, generating wildly different solutions for every other run or stagnating and getting clipped to the highest possible value, regressing to a stte similar to the initial state where all trails were of equal strength.</p>

<p>[to be updated]</p>
<h4 id="algorithm-time-and-world-time">Algorithm time and world time</h4>
<p>[to be updated]</p>
<h2 id="future-scope">Future scope</h2>
<p>The many approximations and simplifications we had to make given the project timeline (and the nature of the problem we were trying to solve) made for a toy model variant of an already watered down version of the problem. Some improvements I hope to introduce to the existing code are listed below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Vary the orbital velocities of the pieces of debris based on the nature of their orbit to make the set-up seem more realistic</li>
<li>Create elliptic orbits that are closer to the true scale of space debris and centered at one of their foci instead of at the point of intersection of their major and minor axes as they have been used now.</li>
<li>Develop a greater understanding of the interplay between the simulation time and the time rate at which the dynamics make the debris pieces move, accordingly incorporating necessary refinements into the code base for the same.</li>
</ol>
