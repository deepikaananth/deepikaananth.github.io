title: About Me
---
I am Deepika Anantharaman, a 2023 Electrical Engineering Masters graduate from the University of Pennsylvania. I spend my time learning the mathematics behind the modeling, control and optimization of real dynamical systems, projective geometry for computer vision and computational geometry to help visualize them. I regularly use machine learning when the math behind what I wish to code up is too hard or does not have an analytical form. 

For the past year I have been working on data driven learning of Control Barrier Functions for an autonomous robot agent, a research project due publication very soon.

I am currently reading *Out of Control* - The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic world by Kevin Kelly.
