title: About Me
---
I am Deepika Anantharaman, a 2023 Electrical Engineering Masters graduate from the University of Pennsylvania. I enjoy simulating and implementing through code, target applications for a broad range of robotics software. I have experience with the nuances of the computational geometry that drives contemporary perception/vision pipelines, and I also regularly use Machine Learning when analytic solutions are infeasible and/or abundant relevant empirical data is available.

Through my professional career I have worked on variants of SLAM and path planning, pose estimation and 3D reconstruction and data driven learning of Control Barrier Functions for safe autonomous exploration, a research project due publication very soon.

I am currently reading *Out of Control* - The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic world by Kevin Kelly.
